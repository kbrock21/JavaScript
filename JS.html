<h1>JS Example page</h1>
<script>
    console.log("Hello, World!")

    console.log(23 + 97)
    
    console.log(3 + 6 + 9 + 3 + 6 + 9)

    console.log((4 + 6 + 9) / 77)


    let a = 10;
    let b = 7* a;

    const max = 57;
    let actual = max -13;
    let percentage = actual / max;

<h2>Knowledge Check part 1 of JS</h2>
<p>
<h3><br>Name the three ways to declare a variable</br></h3>
<br>Variables hold information, they are  named storage for data.<br> 
1- const- unchanging variables, use const instead of let. 
<br>2- var-
<br>3- let- example let message;
message = "hello world!" 
<h4>Which of the three variable declarations should you avoid and why?</h4>
Var becasue it is outdated and no longer used.

<h4>What rules should you follow when naming variables?</h4>
Variables should have a clear and obvious meaning, describing the data that it stores. most important and complex skills in programming. 
The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
The first character must not be a digit.


<h4>What happens when you add numbers and strings together?</h4>
Usually, the plus operator + sums numbers.
But, if the binary + is applied to strings, it merges <b>concatenates</b> them:

let s = "my" + "string";
alert(s); // mystring

Note that if any of the operands is a string, then the other one is converted to a string too.

For example:<br>

<br>alert( '1' + 2 ); // "12"<br>
<br>alert( 2 + '1' ); // "21"<br>


See, it doesn’t matter whether the first operand is a string or the second one.

<br>Here’s a more complex example:<br>

alert(2 + 2 + '1' ); // "41" and not "221"


<h4>How does the Modulo (%), or Remainder, operator work?</h4>

The remainder operator %, despite its appearance, is not related to percents.

The result of a % b is the remainder of the integer division of a by b.

<br>For instance:</br>

<br>alert( 5 % 2 ); // 1, the remainder of 5 divided by 2
alert( 8 % 3 ); // 2, the remainder of 8 divided by 3
alert( 8 % 4 ); // 0, the remainder of 8 divided by 4</br>

<h4>Explain the difference between == and ===.</h4>
<br> '==' <b>Equatily operator</b>, it compares the vaules for equatily after <b>type coercion</b> is performed. which means the operand are converted to the same typer before comparison is made.<br>
<b>Example:</b> compare a string and a number using '==' JS will attempt to convert the string to a number or vs. the compare vaules.<br>
'5'=='5' will return 'True'<br>
<br>'==='<b>Strict equality</b> operator, compares the vaules as well as data types of the operands without performing <b>type coercion.</b>
<br> If data types are different the '===' operator will return 'false' without trying to convert the operands to the same data type.<br>
<b>Example:</b> '5'==='5' would return 'false' because data types are different (number & string).

<h4>When would you receive a NaN result?</h4>

When the result is not a number(NaN).<br>

when an expression results in a number that is undefined or can't be represented. 


<h4>How do you increment and decrement a number?</h4>

Increment / Decrement <br>
Increaseing or decreasing a number by one is among the most common numerical operations. 
<br>Increment ++ increases variable by 1</br>
let counter = 2;
<br>counter++;// same as counter= counter+1
<br> 
Decrement -- decreases a variable by 1;</br>
let counter = 2;<br>
counter --;//same as counter=counter-1


<h4>Explain the difference between prefixing and postfixing increment/decrement operators.</h4>
Postfix form => Counter++ returns to old vaule<br>
let counter=1;<br>
let a = counter++;//<br>
alert(a);//1<br>
<br>Prefix form<br>
let counter=1;<br>
let a= ++counter;//(*)<br>
alert(a);//2
<br>
<h4>What is operator precedence and how is it handled in JS?</h4>

<h4>How do you access developer tools and the console?</h4>
Go to the web page, right click and select inspect, then at the top of the screen click console.<br>
console.log() is the command to print something to the developer console in your browser.

<h4>How do you log information to the console?</h4>

<h4>What does unary plus operator do to string representations of integers? eg. +”10”</h4>
<b>Unary operator</b> unary plus operator (+) can be used to convert a string representation of an integer into an actual numeric value.<br>
When you apply the unary plus operator to a string, JavaScript attempts to convert the string to a number.<br>
<b>Example</b> <br>
let stringNumber = "42";<br>
let numericValue = +stringNumber;<br>
console.log(numericValue); // Output: 42 (a number)<br>
In this case, the unary plus operator converts the string "42" into the numeric value 42.<br>
<br>
When used with a non-numeric string:<br>
let nonNumericString = "hello";<br>
let numericValue = +nonNumericString;<br>
console.log(numericValue); // Output: NaN (Not a Number)
<br>
If the string cannot be converted to a valid number, JavaScript returns NaN.<br>
It's important to note that the unary plus operator only works with strings that represent valid numeric values. <br>
If the string contains non-numeric characters (except for whitespace characters around the number), the result will be NaN.<br>
<br>let invalidString = "42px";<br>
let numericValue = +invalidString;<br>
console.log(numericValue); // Output: NaN<br>
In summary, the unary plus operator in JavaScript is useful for converting string 
representations of integers into actual numeric values, but it's crucial to ensure that the string contains
 a valid numeric representation to avoid unexpected results like NaN.
